# Style_GAN_MRI

In this work, I explored the use of StyleGAN, a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network, to generate synthetic MRI brain scans. The goal? To push the boundaries of medical imaging research by:

âœ… Enhancing data availability for model training
âœ… Preserving patient privacy through synthetic data
âœ… Enabling better generalization in diagnostic models

ðŸ’¡ Highlights of the Project:

Leveraged StyleGAN2 to learn the complex distribution of MRI slices

Applied advanced data preprocessing and normalization techniques

Evaluated generation quality using both visual and statistical methods

Aimed toward potential data augmentation and privacy-preserving applications in radiology.
